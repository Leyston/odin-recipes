    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're thinking about dry-aging your own prime rib of beef for the holidays, start here. After lots of research, I decided I'd have to age the beef at least 30 days for any noticeable change in flavor; it ended up going for 42 days before baking. The meat came out extremely juicy and tender but somehow never developed that funky fermented flavor I wanted. It might've tasted a bit more concentrated, though, after having lost 2 pounds of water weight.</p>

    <h3>Ingredientes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 (10 pound) bone-in prime rib roast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups coarse sea salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup Himalayan pink salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve kosher salt in water and use it to wipe down the prime rib</li>
        <li>Remove prime rib from the fridge</li>
        <li>Remove prime rib from fridge and cover loosely with aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
